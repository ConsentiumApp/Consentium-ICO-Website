<p>This [White Paper/Crowdsale Document/business deck] does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to purchase, the CONSENTIUM TOKENS in any jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be unlawful.

<p>CONSENTIUM TOKENS are intended for use within applications available on the Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd Network for purposes stated in the White Paper and Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd warrants that the CONSENTIUM TOKENS are fit for these purposes.</p>

<p>However, Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd is not responsible for compelling any person to accept CONSENTIUM TOKENS and disclaims, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all liability for any adverse consequences arising out of or in relation to such rejections of CONSENTIUM TOKENS.</p>

<p>The CONSENTIUM TOKENS and related services provided by Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd (if any) are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd does not grant any warranties or make any representation, express or implied or otherwise, as to the accessibility, quality, suitability, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the CONSENTIUM TOKENS or any related services provided by Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd, and expressly disclaims any liability for errors, delays, or omissions in, or for any action taken in reliance on, the CONSENTIUM TOKENS and related services provided by Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd.

<h3>Token Disclaimer</h3>

<p>The Consentium Coin tokens are not securities under Singapore’s Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289) (“SFA”). They grant holders access to certain services within the Consentium ChatApp ecosystem. They are utility tokens whose entire value derives from the services provided by the Consentium ChatApp Network in exchange for holding or consumption of the tokens, as detailed here. They are not intended for speculation and hold no rights to intellectual or other property or cash flows. They are not equities, as they do not provide any fractional ownership rights in the company and no claim in decision making over company assets or strategy. There is no promise of value or claim on revenue associated with the Consentium Coin tokens, similar to debentures, other than that derived from platform usage. In short, PPN tokens are not equities, debentures or any form of securities as defined under the SFA.</p>

<h3>Regulatory Risks</h3>

<p>The regulation of tokens such as the CONSENTIUM TOKENS is still in a very nascent stage of development in Singapore. A high degree of uncertainty as to how tokens and token-related activities are to be treated exists. The applicable legal and regulatory framework may change subsequent to the date of issuance of this [White Paper/Crowdsale Document]. Such change may be very rapid and it is not possible to anticipate with any degree of certainty the nature of such regulatory evolution. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd does not in any way represent that the regulatory status of the CONSENTIUM TOKENS will remain unaffected by any regulatory changes that arise at any point in time before, during, and after this offering.</p>

<h3>Tax Risks</h3>

<p>The tax characterization of CONSENTIUM TOKENS is unclear. Accordingly, the tax treatment to which they will be subject is uncertain. All persons who wish to purchase CONSENTIUM TOKENS should seek independent tax advice prior to deciding whether to purchase any CONSENTIUM TOKENS. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd does not make any representation as to whether any tax consequences may arise from purchasing or holding CONSENTIUM TOKENS.</p>

<h3>Risk From Third Parties</h3>

<p>The tokenised nature of CONSENTIUM TOKENS means that they are a blockchain-based asset. The security, transferability, storage, and accessibility of blockchain assets depends on factors outside of Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd’s control, such as the security, stability, and suitability of the underlying blockchain (in this case, the Ethereum blockchain), mining attacks, and who has access to the private key of a wallet where CONSENTIUM TOKENS are stored. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd is unable to assure that it can prevent such external factors from having any direct or indirect adverse impact on any of the CONSENTIUM TOKENS. Persons intending to purchase CONSENTIUM TOKENS should note that adverse events caused by such external factors may results in the loss of some or all CONSENTIUM TOKENS purchased. Such loss may be irreversible. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd is not responsible for taking steps to retrieve CONSENTIUM TOKENS lost in this manner.</p>
<h3>Risks in purchasing CONSENTIUM TOKENS</h3>

<p>Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd cannot and does not guarantee or otherwise assure that there are no risks in relation to your purchase of CONSENTIUM TOKENS. The purchase of CONSENTIUM TOKENS may, depending on the manner in which the relevant purchase is effected, involve third parties or external platforms (e.g., wallets). The involvement of such parties or platforms may introduce risks that would not otherwise be present, such as misconduct or fraud by the third party, or your failure to receive CONSENTIUM TOKENS upon duly making payment because of a third-party wallet’s incompatibility with CONSENTIUM TOKENS. Asia Focus Group Pte Ltd is not responsible for any risks arising due to the involvement of third parties, including the risk of not receiving (or subsequently losing) any or all CONSENTIUM TOKENS you attempt to (or successfully) purchase.</p>
